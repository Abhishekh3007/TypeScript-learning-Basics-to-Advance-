# TypeScript Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! This is a documented journey of learning TypeScript from basics to advanced concepts.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as:
- **Personal Documentation**: My notes and code examples as I learn TypeScript
- **Revision Material**: A quick reference for revisiting concepts
- **Learning Resource**: A guide for anyone who wants to learn or revise TypeScript concepts

## 🎯 Learning Approach

I'm learning TypeScript progressively, starting from fundamentals and moving towards advanced topics. Each concept is documented with:
- Code examples
- Practical implementations
- Key takeaways and notes

## 📖 Topics Covered

### Basics
- [x] Basic Types (string, number, boolean)
- [x] Variables and Constants (let, const)
- [x] Type Annotations
- [x] Type Inference
- [x] Union Types
- [x] Any Type
- [x] Functions with Type Annotations
- [x] Type Narrowing

### Intermediate
- [ ] Interfaces
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Intersection Types
- [ ] Type Aliases
- [ ] Literal Types
- [ ] Arrays and Tuples
- [ ] Objects

### Advanced
- [ ] Advanced Types
- [ ] Decorators
- [ ] Modules and Namespaces
- [ ] TypeScript with React/Node.js
- [ ] Type Guards
- [ ] Utility Types
- [ ] Mapped Types
- [ ] Conditional Types

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
TypeScript/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          # Entry point with functions
│   ├── typesTs.ts        # Basic types, type annotations, type inference
│   ├── unionAndany.ts    # Union types and any type
│   └── typeNarrowing.ts  # Type narrowing with typeof checks
├── dist/                 # Compiled JavaScript files (gitignored)
├── Basic.ts              # Initial basic concepts

```

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile all TypeScript files
npx tsc

# Run the compiled output
node dist/index.js

# Or compile and run a single file
tsc filename.ts && node filename.js
```

## 📝 Progress Log

- **Started**: February 17, 2026
- **Day 2**: Added type narrowing with typeof checks and conditional type refinement
- **Day 1**: Covered basic types, type annotations, type inference, union types, any type, and basic functions
- Currently working on: Expanding to intermediate TypeScript concepts

## 🤝 Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, suggestions and improvements are welcome! Feel free to:
- Point out errors or better practices
- Suggest additional concepts to explore
- Share alternative approaches

## 📚 Resources

Resources I'm using for learning:
- Official TypeScript Documentation
- TypeScript Handbook
- (Will add more as I discover them)

## 📌 Notes

This is a living document that will evolve as I deepen my understanding of TypeScript. Check back regularly for updates!
